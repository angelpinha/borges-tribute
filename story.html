  <h1>The House of Asterion</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    <p> And the queen gave birth to a child who was called Asterion.</p>
    <br>
    <p dir="rtl">Apollodorus Bibliotecha III, I</p>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <div id="content">

    <p>I know they accuse me of arrogance, and perhaps
    misanthropy, and perhaps of madness. Such accusations (for
    which I shall exact punishment in due time) are derisory.
    It is true that I never leave my house, but it is also true
    that its doors (whose numbers are infinite) (footnote: The
    original says <i>fourteen,</i> but there is ample reason
    to infer that, as used by Asterion, this numeral stands
    for <i>infinite.</i>) are open day and night to men and
    to animals as well. Anyone may enter. He will find here no
    female pomp nor gallant court formality, but he will find
    quiet and solitude. And he will also find a house like
    no other on the face of this earth. (There are those who
    declare there is a similar one in Egypt, but they lie.)
    Even my detractors admit there is not one single piece of
    furniture in the house. Another ridiculous falsehood has
    it that I, Asterion, am a prisoner. Shall I repeat that
    there are no locked doors, shall I add that there are no
    locks? Besides, one afternoon I did step into the street;
    If I returned before night, I did so because of the fear
    that the faces of the common people inspired in me, faces
    as discolored and flat as the palm of one's hand. the sun
    had already set ,but the helpless crying of a child and
    the rude supplications of the faithful told me I had been
    recognized. The people prayed, fled, prostrated themselves;
    some climbed onto the stylobate of the temple of the axes,
    others gathered stones. One of them, I believe, hid himself
    beneath the sea. Not for nothing was my mother a queen;
    I cannot be confused with the populace, though my modesty
    might so desire. The fact is that that I am unique. I am
    not interested in what one man may transmit to other men;
    like the philosopher I think that nothing is communicable by
    the art of writing. Bothersome and trivial details have no
    place in my spirit, which is prepared for all that is vast
    and grand; I have never retained the difference between one
    letter and another. A certain generous impatience has not
    permitted that I learn to read. Sometimes I deplore this,
    for the nights and days are long.</p>

    <p>Of course, I am not without distractions. Like the ram
    about to charge, I run through the stone galleries until I
    fall dizzy to the floor. I crouch in the shadow of a pool
    or around a corner and pretend I am being followed. There
    are roofs from which I let myself fall until I am bloody.
    At any time I can pretend to be asleep, with my eyes closed
    and my breathing heavy. (Sometimes I really sleep, sometimes
    the color of day has changed when I open my eyes.) But of
    all the games, I prefer the one about the other Asterion.
    I pretend that he comes to visit me and that I show him
    my house. With great obeisance I say to him "Now we shall
    return to the first intersection" or "Now we shall come out
    into another courtyard" Or "I knew you would like the drain"
    or "Now you will see a pool that was filled with sand" or
    "You will soon see how the cellar branches out". Sometimes I
    make a mistake and the two of us laugh heartily.</p>

    <p>Not only have I imagined these games, I have also meditated
    on the house. All parts of the house are repeated many
    times, any place is another place. There is no one pool,
    courtyard, drinking trough, manger; the mangers, drinking
    troughs, courtyards pools are fourteen (infinite) in number.
    The house is the same size as the world; or rather it is
    the world. However, by dint of exhausting the courtyards
    with pools and dusty gray stone galleries I have reached
    the streetand seen the temple of the Axes and the sea. I did
    not understand this until a night vision revealed to me that
    the seas and temples are also fourteen (infinite) in number.
    Everything is repeated many times, fourteen times, but two
    things in the world seem to be repeated only once: above,
    the intricate sun; below Asterion. Perhaps I have created
    the stars and the sun and this enormous house, but I no
    longer remember.</p>

    <p>Every nine years nine men enter the house so that I may
    deliver them from evil. I hear their steps or their voices
    in the depths of the stone galleries and I run joyfully to
    find them. The ceremony lasts a few minutes. They fall one
    after another without my having to bloody my hands. They
    remain where they fell and their bodies help distinguish
    one gallery from another. I do not know who they are, but
    I know that one of them prophesied, at the moment of his
    death, that some day my redeemer would come. Since then
    my loneliness does not pain me, because I know my redeemer
    lives and he will finally rise above the dust. If my ear
    could capture all the sounds of the world, I should hear
    his steps. I hope he will take me to a place with fewer
    galleries fewer doors. What will my redeemer be like? I ask
    myself. Will he be a bull or a man? will he perhaps be a
    bull with the face of a man? or will he be like me?</p>

    <p>The morning sun reverberated from the bronze sword. There
    was no longer even a vestige of blood. "Would you believe
    it, Ariadne?" said Theseus "The Minotaur scarcely defended
    himself."</p>
