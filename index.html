    <p>Argentine poet, essayist, and short-story writer whose tales of fantasy and
    dreamworlds are classics of the 20th-century world literature. Borges [1899-
    1986] was profoundly influenced by European culture, English literature, and
    such thinkers as Berkeley, who argued that there is no material substance; the
    sensible world consists only of ideas, which exists for so long as they are
    perceived. Most of Borges's tales embrace universal themes - the often recurring
    circular labyrinth can be seen as a metaphor of life or a riddle which theme is
    time. Although his name was mentioned in speculations about Nobel Prize, Borges
    never became a Nobel Laureate. When the end draws near, there no longer
    remain any remembered images; only words remain. It is not strange that time
    should have confused the words that once represented me with those that were
    symbols of the fate of he who accompanied me for so many centuries. I have been
    Homer; shortly, I shall be On One, like Ulysses; shortly, I shall be all men; I
    shall be dead." (from 'The Immortal')</p>

    <p>Jorge Luis Borges was born in Buenos Aires. His family included British ancestry
    and he learned English before Spanish. His father was a lawyer and a psychology
    teacher, who demonstrated the paradoxes of Zeno on a chessboard for his son.
    In the large house was also a library and garden which enchanted Borges's
    imagination. In 1914 the family moved to Geneva, where Borges learned French and
    German and received his B.A. from the Collège of Geneva.</p>

    <p>After World War I the Borges family lived in Spain, where he was a member of
    avant-garde Ultraist literary group. His first poem, 'Hymn to the Sea,' is
    published in the magazine Grecia. In 1921 Borges settled in Buenos Aires and
    started his career as a writer publishing poems and essays in literary journals.
    Among his friends was the philosopher Macedonio Fernandez, whose dedication
    linguistic problems influenced his thought. Borges's first collection of
    poetry, FERVOR DE BUENOS AIRES, appeared in 1923. He contributed to the avant-
    garde review Martin Fierro, co-founded the journals Proa (1924-26) and Sur,
    which became Argentina's most important literary journal, and wrote for Prisma.
    He also served as literary adviser for the publishing house Emecé Editores,
    and wrote weekly columns for El Hogar from 1936 to 1939. As a critic Borges
    gained fame with interpretations of the Argentine classics and displayed a deep
    knowledge of European and American literature, in particular for such writers as
    Poe, Stevenson, Kipling, Shaw, Chesterton, Whitman, Emerson, and Twain.</p>

    <p>Borges's father died in 1938, a great blow because the two had been unusually
    close. Borges also suffered a severe head wound and after recovery the
    experience freed in him deep forces of creativity. His first collection of
    the intricate and fantasy-woven short stories, EL JARDÍN DE SENDEROS QUE SE
    BIFURCAN, was published in 1941. Later collections include FICCIÓNES (1944), EL
    ALEPH (1949), and EL EL HACEDOR (1960). Borges's interest in fantasy was shared
    by another well-known Argentine writer of fiction, Adolfo Bioy Casares, with
    whom Borges coauthored several collections of tales between 1942 and 1967.</p>

    <p>From 1939 to 1946 Borges was a municipal librarian, but he was fired from his
    post by the Péron regime, and between the years 1946 and 1954 he was a poultry
    inspector for Buenos Aires Municipal Market. Borges's political opinions were
    not considered inoffensive and as a sign of negative attention an attempt
    was made to bomb the house where Borges and his mother lived. After Peron's
    deposition Borges was appointed Director of the National Library (1955-1973). "I
    speak of God's splendid irony in granting me at once 800 000 book and darkness,"
    Borges noted alluding to his now almost complete blindness. Borges also was
    professor of literature at the University of Buenos Aires, and taught there
    from 1955 to 1970. In 1961 Borges shared the Prix Formentor with Samuel Beckett.
    During this decade started his series of visits to countries all around the
    world, continuing traveling until his death.</p>

    <p>"A librarian wearing dark glasses asked him: 'What are you looking for?' Hladik
    answered: 'I am looking for God.' The librarian said to him: 'God is in one of
    the letters on one of the pages of one of the four hundred thousand volumes of
    the Clementine. My fathers and the fathers of my fathers have searched for this
    letter; I have grown blind seeking it.'" (from 'The Secret Miracle')</p>

    <p>In 1967 Borges began a five-year period of collaboration with Norman Thomas di
    Giovanni, and gained new fame in the English-speaking world. When Juan Perón
    was again elected president in 1973, Borges resigned as director of the National
    Library. Despite his opposition to Perón and later to the junta, his support to
    liberal causes were considered too ambiguous.</p>

    <p>Borges, who had long suffered from eye problems, become totally blind in his
    last decades. He had a congenital defect that had afflicted several generations
    on his father's side of the family. However, he continued to publish several
    books, among them EL LIBRO DE LOS SERES IMAGINARIOS (1967), EL INFORME DE BRODIE
    (1970), and EL LIBRO DE ARENA (1975). After the death of his mother, who had
    been his constant companion, Borges began travelling feverishly. Borges died on
    June 14, 1986 in Geneva, Switzerland. He was married twice. In 1967 he married
    his old friend, the recently widowed Elsa Asteta Millán. The relationship
    lasted three years. After the divorce, Borges moved back in with his mother. His
    last years Borges lived with María Kodama; they married in 1986. In 1984 they
    produced an account of their journeys in different places of the world, with
    text by Borges and photographs by Kodoma.</p>

    <p>Borges's fictional universe was born from his vast and esoteric readings in
    literature, philosophy, and theology. He sees man's search for meaning in
    an infinite universe as a fruitless effort. In the universe of energy, mass,
    and speed of light, Borges considers the central riddle time, not space.
    "He believed in an infinite series of times, in a growing, dizzying net of
    divergent, convergent and parallel times. This network of times which approached
    one another, forked, broke off, or were unaware of one another for centuries,
    embraces all possibilities of time."</p>
